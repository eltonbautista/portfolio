description: clockedOut is a LinkedIn clone application that focuses on the social aspects of gaming. It is a one-stop destination for creating lifetime companions, and remembering our childhood nostalgia.
problem: Simulate a popular industry-sized application that utilizes a NoSQL database. On top of this problem, I recognized an opportunity to
problemOne: Further my understanding on the intricacies of UI/UX testing.
problemTwo: Develop my problem solving and logical thinking abilities by dealing with higher volumes of REST API calls.
problemThree: Progress my conception of the state management model, and React's recursive nature.
solution: Rather than JavaScript, I opted to use TypeScript instead due to its strongly typed nature. This allowed me to reduce the bugs I encountered, create ease of access for anybody reading my code, and most importantly increase the scalability of my application which is important for addressing my main problem. I utilized Jest for testing due to its compatability with React testing library and asynchronous functionalities. Firebase was my choice for a NoSQL database because of its reliability, rich documentation, and ability to persist data locally and offline which would provide my users a responsive experience. I opted on using React's built-in Context API due to its reliability, built-in support, and minimalistic setup.
shortcomings: After my initial planning phase and working on the application for a few days I realized that I had severely miscalculated the scale of the application. Initially, my goal for clockedOut was to have all of the functionalities and similar design of LinkedIn. Instead I focused on clockedOut being a CRUD application which will later implement messaging and the ability to follow and view others' posts.
builtWith: TypeScript, ReactJS, Firebase, React Router, Jest, Styled-Components, CSS3, HTML5
