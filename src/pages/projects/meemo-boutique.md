description: Meemo Boutique is a single-page ecommerce application that boasts a vintage, but modern neon aesthetic that is focused on uniting both fashion lovers with old souls, and newcomers who aren't afraid to stand out and dare to be different.
problem: Create a fully functional ecommerce webpage application that contains more than two routes. With the exemption of a payment system, the final product should be capable of essential functionalities comparable to those of other ecommerce websites that use a shopping cart model.
problemOne: Develop a greater understanding of component and folder structuring.
problemTwo: Practice and apply my logic and problem-solving skills to better my ability in DOM manipulation and achieving the necessary functionalities as per the spec.
problemThree: Thorougly exercise Jest and React Testing Library as to gain an advantage not only in testing UX/UI, but also to influence my comprehension of clean coding practices, maintainability, and reusability of modules and components.
shortcomings: With my previous experience of building single-page applications I felt great confidence in my ability to tackle this spec. Most of my previous projects were mainly comprised only of vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 as to increase my understanding of programming concepts. This means that I understood the principles behind single-page applications, and how to manage the DOM to receive the results I enquired. Reflecting back on this project, I believe that I could have wrote more comprehensive tests that may have further increased the application's performance. 
shortcomingsTwo: Lastly, through my research and deliberations I learned that UI/UX are two of the most import things that a developer should be focusing on when creating an ecommerce based website. This is because we want to not only attract the consumer, but also make the experience so enjoyable that it almost becomes "addicting" to use the application. With these things in mind, I plan to exhibit even more careful attention to these facets in the future.

<p>
   During my planning phase I focused on both realising the scope of the project, and the appropriate tooling necessary to complete the specification. After doing some research (viewing other ecommerce websites, and creating a comparisons diagram), and some critical thinking I deemed this project to be a medium sized application that may take me one to two weeks to complete. With this in mind I meticulously planned my progression timeline, and personal due dates. 
</p> 

<p>
  To address the task at hand I utilized React due to my familiarity with the frontend framework and the extensible support it currently has. Additionally, React Router had just updated recently and received testing coverage from both Jest testing framework and React Testing Library which I used in conjunction with one another.
</p>

<p>
  I started by creating a minimally styled static version of my application. The purpose of this was to help myself visualize the component tree, minimize the amount of state I needed, and finally configure where each component state should be housed in. Afterwards, I worked on the logic of each functionality whilst simultaneously keeping a focus on the application's maintainability, scalability, and reusability.
