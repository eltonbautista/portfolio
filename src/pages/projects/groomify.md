description: clockedOut is a LinkedIn clone application that focuses on the social aspects of gaming. It is a one-stop destination for creating lifetime companions, and remembering our childhood nostalgia.
problem: Simulate a popular industry-sized application that utilizes a NoSQL database.
goals: On top of this task, I recognized this project as an opportunity to
problemOne: Further my understanding on the intricacies of UI/UX testing.
problemTwo: Develop my problem solving and logical thinking abilities by dealing with higher volumes of REST API calls.
problemThree: Progress my conception of the state management model, and React's recursive nature.
solution: Rather than JavaScript, I opted to use TypeScript instead due to its strongly typed nature. This allowed me to reduce the bugs I encountered, create ease of access for anybody reading my code, and most importantly increase the scalability of my application which is important for addressing my main problem. I utilized Jest for testing due to its compatability with React testing library and readily available asynchronous functionalities. Firebase was my choice for a NoSQL database because of its updatability, rich documentation, and ability to persist data locally and offline which would provide my users a responsive experience. I opted on using React's built-in Context API due to its reliability, built-in support, and minimalistic setup.

shortcomings: After my initial planning phase and working on the application for a few days I realized that I had severely miscalculated the scale of the application that I was trying to build. Initially, my goal for clockedOut was to have all of the functionalities and similar design of LinkedIn. But after some deliberation and limiting myself to a realistic timeline I instead focused on clockedOut being a CRUD application that will later implement instant messaging and follower interactions.

shortcomingsTwo: Before trying to take on the future features I want to implement, I first plan to refactor my code specifically focusing on the Asynchronous processes that occur in my components. I believe that I gained a lot better understanding of Asynchronous programming near the end of the first bout and would like to apply that to my initial code and any forthcoming changes.

  Lastly, I opted on using the Context API baked into React due to its reliability, built-in support, and minimalistic setup.

  For the record, the reason why I've never used a component library or a CSS framework is because I really want to focus on building a solid foundation and understanding <em>why</em> I should create components a certain way, and <em>how</em> to create them.

  This was undoubtedly the largest project I had built so far and rather quickly I realized that I underestimated the amount of the work that it takes to build websites like LinkedIn. I don't believe that I'm too inexperienced to create a clone with similar functionality, but rather I feel like I may have took on too much and may have set an unrealistic timeline for current self.

  One of my main shortcomings was maintaining an organized file structure. I think I made the mistake of not following my previous working process which resulted in not planning as thoroughly as I had been compared to previous projects. Additionally, after a certain point in my project I started to become overwhelmed by the various API calls I was making and quickly became muddled with what to implement next.
