<div class="project split-view-container">
  <p>Hey stranger!<em> Firstly, I'd like to thank you for checking out {projectName}.</em>
    Considering the amount of time I spend on each of my projects (reading documentation, practicing problems, planning,
    and finally building it out) I felt like it would be a shame if I didn't get to talk about them and the process that
    goes behind each one. These project pages aren't Case Studies. Rather, it was a way for me to express my creative
    process, but most importantly, it's a way for me to look back on my previous work and reflect on how to become a
    better developer. Once again I'd like to thank you for checking things out! If you'd like to view some more of my
    project pages, feel
    free to check them out below.
  </p>
