    These are the words that I have grown up by but have never really understood, at least not until recently.
    I have always been fascinated by technology, and thus, things like computers, or cell-phones were second nature
    to me.
    Though I was familiar with these items it felt like there was a missing component, and I yearned for
    whatever that was.

    After tireless hours of studying day in and day out, I think I've realized what I've been missing, and more
    importantly, <i>how to achieve it.
    </i>

    I get <strong class="lost">lost</strong> in writing code! As I sit on my chair
    and type away at the keyboard all I can think about is what I'm building, how
    to build it, and what to build next.

    I <strong class="love">love</strong> learning new technologies, or new patterns,
    or new ideas.

  <p class="about about-paragraph">
    I <strong class="love">love</strong> reading other people's code, trying to figure
    out how to improve on it, and if I can't see how, I recognize that as a learning
    opportunity.

    I <strong class="love">love</strong> teaching others equally as much as I enjoy
    learning from them.
