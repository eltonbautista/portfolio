description: Groomify is a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Vue.js. Groomify takes a great deal of inspiration from Helcim (a local company). Through Groomify's design, copywriting, and teamwork aspect I hoped to capture and reflect Helcim's culture and values, while trying my best to maintain its own identity.
problem: Lead a few developers to design and create a web application that addresses the common problem of aesthetically outdated pet groomer websites and try to implement a more modern approach.
goals: On top of this task, I recognized this project as an opportunity to
problemOne: Learn a few technologies such as the Vue.js framework, and SCSS.
problemTwo: Effectively communicate and delegate directions to other developers as to simulate a professional development atmosphere.
problemThree: Practice design, prototyping, and making mock-ups come to life with Figma.
solution: By studying and analysing a local company I was able to piece together common modern themes and patterns that were considered best practice in the sphere of Web Development. Firstly, I researched the pet grooming business in my local city, and other popular cities around the world and found a commonality between a majority of them which was outdated looking UI. By focusing on a more modern approach to UI/UX I elaborated to my team that we would be able to reach a greater audience and enlargen our target demographic. 

shortcomings: This project taught me a lot about the professional industry and how important it is to effectively communicate with your teammates. One of our major blocks came from the varying degrees of designing/prototyping experience. Being self-taught developers it's a bit more difficult to pinpoint one's weaknesses and develop a solution to them, but I believe that the other members and I did a great job at approaching this shortcoming. Even though we wanted to simulate a professional environment we really tried our best to focus on having fun, and we did exactly that! I think that lead us to effective communications and allowed us to express ourselves as developers and designers throughout the whole experience. 

shortcomingsTwo: Trying to create a more modern approach and design/prototype for it was a bit more work than I had expected. Personally, with my educational background I really enjoy researching and connecting common pieces together. As I looked through popular websites I noticed a lot of themes and patterns I wanted to implement for Groomify, but my other team members had decided to stop working on the project about 1/3 of the way in. This was a bit discouraging to me and it affected my schedule a little bit so I ended up deciding to approach the project in a simpler manner than I had originally wanted.

By focusing on a more modern approach to UI/UX I elaborated to my team that we would be able to reach a greater audience and enlargen our target demographic.

  After my initial research and learning more about the pet grooming business's target demographic I collaborated and instructed with my team to focus on designing the project with careful guidelines. I perceived this to be an important part of the project because one of our main goals was to simulate a professional development atmosphere. I believe that my team and I did a great job as we held regular meetings and reached out to one another explaining what parts we were currently working on.

  All that was left was to build the project and by maintaining a similar approach throughout the whole experience we were able to deliver a great looking product that adheres to common UI/UX best practices.
